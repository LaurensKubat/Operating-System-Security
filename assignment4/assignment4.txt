1b. The gadget pops 3 values of the stack into %rdi, %rsi and %rdx
1c. We find helper() at 0x00401050
    Running readelf -a vuln, we find the following section:
     [24] .bss              NOBITS           0000000000404050  00003050
       0000000000000010  0000000000000000  WA       0     0     8
    .bss is used for variables that have not been allocated. we see the flag
    WA, which stands for write and allocate. Thus we can write to the section
    it is located at: 0x00404050
1d. In stage 1, we put the following values in the buffer; the address of the gadget, a 0,
    the writeable location and read_plt. Using this, we can read an input from stdin 
    In stage 2. We once again put the address of the gadget, the writeable location, two dummy values and the
    address of system()
