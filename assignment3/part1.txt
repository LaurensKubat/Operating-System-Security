We want to overwrite the value of correct to be true, which means it should be > 0, we want to give an input
such that the array password overwrites correct, since the memory is allocated on the heap, we need to give
in input larger than 100 and also overwrite correct, which has the lucky number int inbetween it.
An input of 108 chars gives us access, in this case 108 'a's as can bee seen below
