A.
showdate first checks the userpermissions to /etc/suid-debug using access(),
then tries to get the file descriptor through fcntl three times and then checks the
permissions for /etc/suid-debug and /etc/ld.so.preload through acces()
(strace-output.txt lines 3 through 8)
showdate then tries to set its uid and gid to 0 (root), line 29-30
showdate then calls fork() and forks into 2 child processes. One of which gets the
date and outputs it. The other child tries to open a shell(line 160)

B.
As know, showdate forks 2 children, one shows the date and the other
does setuid(0) and open a shell using execve(/bin/sh). Somehow we need to
get access to that shell opened by the second child, since that is a root shell,
but i cant figure out how to access it

C.
A developer should be sure to set the uid back to that of the user after the 
programme is done with every actions that needs to be different permissions than
that of the user that executes it. eg.

uuid = getuid();
setuid(0);
// do something as root
setuid(uuid);
