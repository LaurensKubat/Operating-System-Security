A.
The cr4 register is used to control multiple settings, such as page size extension.
Page size extension is a flag which if it is 0, the page size is 4KiB, if 1, page
size is 4MiB. Now if this is 0 and a programme can set it to 1, the programme can
read into the memory space of other programmes (The increase in size causes pages 
to overlap), which a user programme isnt supposed to be able to do. Thus a user 
programme shouldn't be able to write to cr4

B.
0x55555555513d <main+8>                 mov    %cr4,%rax 
causes the segmentation fault. It tries to move the contents of %rax into %cr4.
thus into control register 4.
